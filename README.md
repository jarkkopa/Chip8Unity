# Chip8Unity
CHIP-8 interpreter for Unity3D

# Roms
Currently there are no Roms in this repository because of copyrights.
You can however use Unity editor to assign your own roms to roms list of Chip8Controller. Chip8Controller component is attached to GameObject of same name.
Rom files should have .bytes file extension in order to load properly in Unity.
